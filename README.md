# Hash-Table-Implementation-
description 
 * Overview: this program implements hash table
 *           it allows the following:
 *
 *           1- Insertion by Linear probing
 *           2- Insertion by Quadratic probing
 *           3- delete an integer and returning the array without that integer
 *           4- Search for an integer and get to know if it exists (True)
 *           Or it is not there (False)
 *
 *           All the above take place by the user choice,
 *           Also, the loading factor of our table is always taken into consideration
 *           WHILE INSERTING ANY INTEGER
 *
 * NB. In this program, any Zero is considered to be a NULL element
 * Accordingly, the user should insert any integer OTHER THAN ZERO
